# OmniCar Grid Avoidance

This task models a rectangular omnidirectional car that receives a user command
`[vx, vy, vyaw]` and must keep that intent when the local grid is safe, while
deviating smoothly when obstacles block the path.

## Observation and action

- Grid input: `80 x 80`, `0.05 m` per cell, centered on the robot body frame.
- Policy input: occupancy grid, current smoothed command, current velocity, last
  action, command history, velocity history, action history, nearest clearance,
  and collision flag.
- Action output: body-frame `vx`, `vy`, `vyaw`.
- Physical limits are enforced before integration. Tracking smoothness is shaped
  in reward, while absolute feasibility comes from velocity and acceleration
  caps.

## Current training profile

The MuJoCo owner config lives in
`conf/ppo/task/omni_car_grid_avoidance/mujoco.yaml`.

Current defaults in this branch:

- Episode horizon: `60 s`
- Observation history: `24` frames
- Command resample interval: `1.5 s`
- Command smoothing time constant: `0.40 s`
- PPO rollout: `128` envs, `32` steps per env
- Policy architecture: `OmniCarGridCNNModel` (`CNN + MLP`)

Reward shaping emphasizes four things:

1. Track commanded planar and yaw intent.
2. Improve response speed when clearance allows.
3. Penalize per-axis action diff and jerk independently for `vx`, `vy`, `vyaw`.
4. Preserve clearance and heavily punish collision.

## Training

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task omni_car_grid_avoidance --sim mujoco \
  training.logger=tensorboard \
  algo.num_envs=128 \
  algo.num_steps_per_env=32
```

On Linux, keep the default `uv` torch source on `cu128`. The previous
`2.7.0+cu128` build is not sufficient for RTX 50-series (`sm_120`) GPUs; the
current repo baseline is `torch 2.11.0+cu128`.

If you want a longer run similar to the latest tuning pass:

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task omni_car_grid_avoidance --sim mujoco \
  training.logger=tensorboard \
  algo.num_envs=128 \
  algo.num_steps_per_env=32 \
  algo.max_iterations=94
```

## Native viewer

Open the native OpenGL viewer with a hand-authored policy:

```bash
uv run python scripts/visualize_omni_car.py --policy reflex --steps 600 --seed 7 --obstacles 20
```

Because the script now has a shebang, this also works after checkout:

```bash
uv run scripts/visualize_omni_car.py --policy intent --steps 600
```

## Checkpoint playback

For trained checkpoints, use the UniLab evaluation CLI:

```bash
uv run eval --algo ppo --task omni_car_grid_avoidance --sim mujoco \
  --render-mode interactive \
  --load-run /absolute/path/to/run_dir \
  --checkpoint model_40.pt
```

`--checkpoint` also accepts an iteration number such as `40` when the
corresponding `model_40.pt` exists under the run directory.

For a direct native 3D viewer entrypoint dedicated to this task:

```bash
uv run scripts/view_omni_car_checkpoint.py \
  --load-run /absolute/path/to/run_dir \
  --checkpoint 93
```
